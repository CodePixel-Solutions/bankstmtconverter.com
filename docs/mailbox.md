2. In the **To** field, paste your mailbox address (copy it from Dashboard ‚Üí Mailboxes).  
3. Add a **Subject**.  
4. In the email body, include any notes or instructions for parsing (optional).  
5. Attach the PDF bank statement(s). **Check your plan limits** for maximum attachments (see table below).  
6. The **total size of all attachments must not exceed 20 MB**.  
7. Click **Send**.  
8. Open your Bank Statement Converter Dashboard ‚Üí **Mailbox**. You should see the incoming message.  
9. When the item is **Completed**, click it and download the converted file(s).
