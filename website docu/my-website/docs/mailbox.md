## Automate Data Extraction from Your Emails

Welcome to **Bank Statement Converter** — a simple way to extract data from emails automatically and turn attached bank statements into structured files you can download and use.

This guide explains how the Mailbox (Inbox) works, how to send or forward emails from Gmail, what happens after an email is received, plan limits, and troubleshooting tips.

## How the mailbox works

* **Inbox (Mailbox):** Your account gets a unique email address (an *Inbox*) that looks like a one-time address configured for your account. You can find the exact address in your Dashboard under **Mailbox**. Copy that address when you need to send or forward emails.


## Step-by-step-procedure 

1. Open Gmail and click **Compose**.
2. In the **To** field, paste your mailbox address (copy it from Dashboard → Mailboxes).
3. Add a **Subject** .
4. In the email body include any notes or instructions for parsing (optional).
5. Attach the PDF bank statement(s). **Check your plan limits** for maximum attachments (see Pricing below).
6. Click **Send**.
7. Open your Bank Statement Converter Dashboard → **Mailbox**. You should see the incoming message. 
8. When the item is **Completed**, click it and download the converted file(s).

- Additionally, attached the **reference Screenshots** at the bottom.

## What happens after the mail is received

* The message appears in Dashboard → **Mailbox**.
* Statuses explained briefly:
  * **Queued** — waiting its turn (Processing Mode: queue).
  * **Processing** — parsing and conversion are running.
  * **Completed** — the output is ready to download.
